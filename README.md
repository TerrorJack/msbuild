## Motivation

> Why did it turn out like this...?
> I fell for Haskell for the very first time.
> And made a friend with Windows.
> These two wonderful things joined together.
> The joy from the two,
> Thus, brought me even more happiness.
> Like something out a beautiful dream, that's what it was supposed to be...
> But then, why... Did it turn out like this...?
